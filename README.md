# Scrolling-text-from-matrix-movie
Sourcecode that opens a window, containing some running green text lines. Similar to that in the movie matrix.

Performance isnt very good on slow machines. Maybe another graphical framework would be better for the implemantion, than tkinter.
Another solution could be an implementation, that uses a pixel graphic buffer and native drawing commands, instead of using objects to remember what to draw.
